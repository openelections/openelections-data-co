# openelections-data-co
Pre-processed election results for Colorado elections.

[OpenElections](http://www.openelections.net) is a non-profit effort to collect and publish standardized data from election results at the federal and state level. Part of our process is to convert precinct-level results from PDF documents into spreadsheet-readable files (CSVs).

That's where you can help! If you can copy and paste, you can help make it easier for citizens, journalists and researchers to access accurate data about Colorado elections. To convert PDFs, we use [Tabula](http://tabula.technology), which is free to use. We've created a [short video showing how the process works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9680dgqIc).

If you have a GitHub account, you can fork this repository, pick from one of the [issues](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-co/issues) and get to work. If you don't have a GitHub account, that's ok - email us at openelections@gmail.com and we can get you started. You also can convert a file and email it to us at the same address.

Here's [an example](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-co/blob/master/2012/20120612__co__primary__dolores__precinct.csv) of what a finished CSV file looks like. The first row has the following headers: `county`, `precinct`, `office`, `district`, `party`, `candidate`, `votes`

The name of the file is based on our [format](http://docs.openelections.net/archive-standardization/), but you don't need to get that perfect to contribute.

There are [many ways to get involved](http://docs.openelections.net/) with the project - check them out and see where you can plug in!
